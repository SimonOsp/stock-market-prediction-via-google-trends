# Branch: `webpage`

On [this webpage](https://cristianpjensen.github.io/Stock-Market-Prediction-via-Google-Trends/), a scroller is built to visualise all needed manipulations to the raw data from Google Trends and their reasons. These visualisations have been made using D3.js: a very popular and beautiful visualisation framework in JavaScript.

The "current state of the algorithm"-section is using DJIA stock price data as a placeholder. This is because the machine learning hasn't been deployed yet. Thus a placeholder was needed.

All data used in the visualisations are also actual data used in the machine learning algorithm.
