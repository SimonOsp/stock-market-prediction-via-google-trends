# Branch: `webpage`

On [this webpage](https://cristianpjensen.github.io/Stock-Market-Prediction-via-Google-Trends/), a scroller is built to visualise all needed manipulations to the raw data from Google Trends and their reasons. These visualisations have been made using [D3.js](https://d3js.org): a very popular and beautiful visualisation framework in JavaScript.

All data used in the visualisations are also actual data used in the machine learning algorithm.
