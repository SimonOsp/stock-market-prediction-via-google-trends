## About <a name = "about"></a>

The data used by Njord is downloaded from [Google Trends](https://trends.google.com). The concept for this project came from a research by Tobias Preis, Helen Susannah Moat, and H. Eugene Stanley, ["Quantifying Trading Behavior in Financial Markets Using _Google Trends_"](https://www.nature.com/articles/srep01684?__hstc=113740504.2a1e835c34ab7bf88e972fdd7a7debc8.1424476800061.1424476800062.1424476800063.1&__hssc=113740504.1.1424476800064&__hsfp=3972014050). In this research was found that the search volume for certain (financial) words are linked to the stock price of the Dow Jones Industrial Average stock price, and can in most cases predict a dip in the market. The purpose of this project is to combine this research with machine learning.

### Data Collection <a name = "data_collection"></a>

Two datasets were needed for this project; the Google Trends daily data for a specific keyword and the stock price daily data for a specific ticker. To collect the Google Trends daily data, you have to download all 6-month increments, 5-year increments, and 2004-present within the 2004-2020 timespan. All this data will eventually be adjusted to be relative to eachother, instead of only within it's respective timespan. To collect the stock price daily data for a specific ticker you want to predict, you have to download it from a website like [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com), where you can download the historical data of any ticker.

### Data Visualization <a name = "data_visualization"></a>

#### Correlation <a name = "correlation"></a>
To prove that there indeed is a correlation between Google Trends data (e.g. 'debt') and stock prices (e.g. Dow Jones Industrial Average). I created a graph plotting these two against eachother:

  <b>Figure 1.</b> A graph where the stock price of DJIA is plotted against the relative search volume of the search term 'debt'. The red and green vertical lines indicate a spike in the amount of searches and a dip in the stock market respectively.

#### Adjusted <a name = "adjusted"></a>

After all adjustments of the data to eventually get _relative_ daily data, which is actually relative to eachother, the data visually looks as follows:

### Restrictions <a name = "restrictions"></a>

All data on Google Trends is relative (0-100) to eachother within one timeframe and you can only get daily data in 6-month increments, weekly data in 5-year increments, and only monthly data is provided for the entire timespan available. So to aggregate all data needed for this project was quite a challenge and because of these restrictions aren't completely accurate, however the method I used was the only method to getting daily data over the entire timespan available (which is crucial for this project).

### Method <a name = "method"></a>

To get all the data relative to eachother, instead of only within it's 6-month increment, I had to merge them together based on weekly data. However, the weekly data is only available in 5-year increments, so I had to merge these 5-year increments together based on the monthly data, which is available for timespan needed for this project. To merge all the 6-month, and 5-year increments, I computed the percentage change of each data point within it's respective increment. Afterwards I got one data point from the higher up periodicity data per increment and computed the missing days by applying the percentage change to the provided data point.

#### Example <a name = "example_merge"></a>

An example for the search term 'debt' ('debt' is the best search term to predict market change, according to the research mentioned earlier) in the timespan 2007-2009:
