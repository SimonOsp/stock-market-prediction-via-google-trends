# Data

To be able to use the data over large timeframes, the data has to be adjusted. The process behind manipulating the data is described in detail in the main [README](https://github.com/cristianpjensen/Njord/blob/master/README.md). However, here are some graphs made with the data.

  <b>Figure 1.</b> Nine keywords were used for these plots. In my opinion, these are the ones that correlate the best with the DJIA stock price (in contrast with the 91 keywords in total).
